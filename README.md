# zig-plotille

Draw in the terminal.

- Use colors: ansi, 8bit or true color, if your terminal allows.
- Have a canvas for general braille dots drawing.
- Have a crappy hist implementation (TODO insert link).
- Have a figure for scatter plots, histograms, line plots. Also supports text and vline, vspan, hline, hspan.

Re-implementation of the (python) [plotille](https://github.com/tammoippen/plotille) with the intention to (at some point) provide a C-API as well.

For usage (for now) have a look at the examples/ and also in the code (tests).
